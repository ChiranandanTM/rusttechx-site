                        countries. In such cases, prior to the transfer we ensure that either the data recipient
                        provides an appropriate level of data protection or that you have consented to the transfer. You
                        are entitled to receive an overview of third country recipients and a copy of the specifically

                        connected services or for as long as we have a legitimate interest in storing the data (e.g. we

                        contractual obligations). In all other cases we delete your personal data with the exception of
                        data we are obliged to store for the fulfillment of legal obligations (e.g. due to retention
                        periods under the tax and commercial codes we are obliged to have documents such as contracts
                        and invoices available for a certain period of time).</p>

                    <h2 class="section-subtitle fade-in delay-4">5. Plugins</h2>
                    <p>Our online offers include the use of plugins provided by various social and other networks.</p>
                    <p>These plugins are additional features made available by the network providers.</p>
                    <p>As a default setting, these plugins are inactive.</p>
                    <p>To enhance the protection of your data when visiting our website, we use a "2-click solution" to
                        integrate the plugins into the page. This 2-click solution keeps your visit to our websites from
                        being recorded and possibly evaluated by the providers of the respective plugins by default.</p>
                    <p>If you do not wish the providers of the respective networks to receive data about your use of
                        this online offer and possibly to store or further use this data, you should not activate the
                        respective plugins.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Activating plugins<br>
                            You yourself can decide whether you want to interact with the respective provider's network
                            and whether your data is to be transmitted to the respective provider or not. Only if you
                            click on the button provided ("Agree") will the respective plugin be activated and
                            integrated into the page, and the content of the respective plugin be transmitted from the
                            server of the associated provider directly to your browser. A second click will then allow
                            you to perform the desired interaction with the network. If you decide to activate a plugin,
                            you give us permission to process your data based on your consent.</li>
                        <li>Collection of data by providers<br>
                            When a plugin is activated, your internet browser establishes a direct connection to the
                            respective provider's servers. Even if you do not have a user account with the provider or
                            are not currently logged in to such an account, this connection notifies the respective
                            provider that your internet browser has called up the corresponding page of our online
                            offer. If you already have a user account with a provider of a network and are already
                            logged in when you visit our websites, the operator of the respective network may be able to
                            assign the visit to your personal user account as soon as you activate plugins. This may
                            enable the provider to analyze your usage behavior and store it in a profile. In addition,
                            your IP address and other data about your browser settings will be transmitted by your
                            internet browser directly to a server of the respective provider and may be stored there.
                        </li>
                        <li>Further processing of data by providers<br>
                            Plugins are additional features made available by network providers. We therefore have no
                            influence on the further processing of the data that the respective network providers'
                            plugins collect and store. To find out more about the purpose and scope of each provider's
                            activities to collect, further process, and delete data, as well as about your respective
                            rights and data protection options, please consult the respective provider's privacy policy.
                        </li>
                        <li>Deactivate the plugin<br>
                            If you activate a plugin, the activation applies to the specific plugin only, and only for
                            as long as you visit the page into which the plugin is integrated. If you no longer wish to
                            use an activated plugin, it can be deactivated by reloading the website. Please note that
                            this does not affect data that has already been transmitted.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We use plugins from the providers listed below:</p>

                        the playback of audio and video files.</p>
                    <p>In order to enhance your data protection when visiting our website, the YouTube content is
                        integrated into the page in "enhanced privacy mode."</p>
                    <p>This means that the video will only be loaded and a connection to YouTube, including a
                        transmission of log data to YouTube, only established once the corresponding plugin has been
                        activated. If the plugin is activated, data will also be transmitted to YouTube and the Google
                        DoubleClick advertising network contacted. This may trigger further data processing operations
                        over which we have no control. If the YouTube video is loaded, cookies are also used.</p>
                    <p>To find out more about the scope and purpose of YouTube's activities to collect, further process,
                        and use data, about possible transfers of personal data to third countries such as the United

                        Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland ("Google Maps").</p>
                    <p>In order to enhance your data protection when visiting our website, the Google Maps content is
                        integrated into the page in "enhanced privacy mode."</p>
                    <p>This means that the map will only be loaded and a connection to Google Maps, including a
                        transmission of log data to Google Maps, only established once the corresponding plugin has been
                        activated. If the plugin is activated, data will be transmitted to Google and the Google
                        DoubleClick advertising network contacted. This may trigger further data processing operations
                        over which we have no control. If the map is loaded, cookies are also used.</p>
                    <p>To find out more about the scope and purpose of Google Maps' activities to collect, further
                        process, and use data, about possible transfers of personal data to third countries such as the

                    <h2 class="section-subtitle fade-in delay-4">6. Content Delivery Network of Microsoft Azure</h2>
                    <p>In order to optimize the loading times of our online offer, we use Azure Content Delivery Network
                        (CDN) Services. Providers are Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399,
                        USA and Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited, One Microsoft Place, South County Business Park,
                        Leopardstown, Dublin 18 D18, Ireland.</p>
                    <p>The CDN helps to provide the content of our online offer — especially large media files such as
                        graphics, text, or scripts — more quickly with the help of a network of geographically
                        distributed servers, thereby reducing loading times.</p>
                    <p>The use of the CDN services is based on our overriding legitimate interest within the meaning of
                        article 8 section 1 lit. f GDPR in the efficient provision of our online offer.</p>
                    <p>In context of this processing, personal data is transmitted to the USA. The transmission is based
                        on European Standard Contractual Clauses in which Microsoft guarantees to comply with the
                        European data protection law for its provided services.</p>
                    <p>Further information on privacy in connection with Microsoft's CDN service is available here:

                    <h2 class="section-subtitle fade-in delay-4">7. External Links</h2>
                    <p>Our online offers may contain links to internet pages of third parties, in particular providers
                        who are not related to us. Upon clicking on the link, we have no influence on the collecting,
                        processing, and use of personal data possibly transmitted by clicking on the link to the third
                        party (such as the IP address or the URL of the site on which the link is located) as the
                        conduct of third parties is naturally beyond our control. We do not assume responsibility for
                        the processing of personal data by third parties.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-subtitle fade-in delay-4">8. Security</h2>
                    <p>Our employees and the companies providing services on our behalf, are obliged to confidentiality
                        and to compliance with the applicable data protection laws. We take all necessary technical and
                        organizational measures to ensure an appropriate level of security and to protect your data that
                        are administrated by us especially from the risks of unintended or unlawful destruction,
                        manipulation, loss, change, or unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access. Our security
                        measures are, pursuant to technological progress, constantly being improved.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-subtitle fade-in delay-4">9. User rights</h2>

                        doing so, please ensure that an unambiguous identification of your person is possible.</p>

                    <h3>9.1 - Right to information and access</h3>
                    <p>You have the right to obtain confirmation from us about whether or not your personal data is
                        being processed, and, if this is the case, access to your personal data.</p>

                    <h3>9.2 - Right to correction and deletion</h3>
                    <p>You have the right to obtain the rectification of inaccurate personal data. As far as statutory
                        requirements are fulfilled, you have the right to obtain the completion or deletion of your
                        data.</p>
                    <p>This does not apply to data which is necessary for billing or accounting purposes or which is
                        subject to a statutory retention period. If access to such data is not required, however, its
                        processing is restricted (see the following).</p>

                    <h3>9.3 - Restriction of processing</h3>
                    <p>As far as statutory requirements are fulfilled you have the right to demand for restriction of
                        the processing of your data.</p>

                    <h3>9.4 - Data portability</h3>
                    <p>As far as statutory requirements are fulfilled you may request to receive data that you have
                        provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format or – if technically
                        feasible – that we transfer those data to a third party.</p>

                    <h3>9.5 - Right of objection</h3>
                    <h4>9.5.1 - Objection to direct marketing</h4>
                    <p>Additionally, you may object to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing
                        purposes at any time. Please take into account that due to organizational reasons, there might
                        be an overlap between your objection and the usage of your data within the scope of a campaign
                        which is already running.</p>

                    <h4>9.5.2 - Objection to data processing based on the legal basis of "legitimate interest"</h4>
                    <p>In addition, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time,
                        insofar as this is based on "legitimate interest". We will then terminate the processing of your
                        data, unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds according to legal requirements which
                        override your rights.</p>

                    <h3>9.6 - Withdrawal of consent</h3>
                    <p>In case you consented to the processing of your data, you have the right to revoke this consent
                        at any time with effect for the future. The lawfulness of data processing prior to your
                        withdrawal remains unchanged.</p>
